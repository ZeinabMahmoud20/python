There is no "Overloading" in Python as :

Python doesn’t declare types in method declarations,in Python, you’d have:

    def getUser(user):
    	pass

So you if you made one method to take a string,
and one method to take an int,
 you’d have the same method declaration,
 and Python wouldn’t be able to tell them apart.
